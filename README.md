This application asks if the user is a cat or dog person, allowing them to choose between two buttons determining this. Based on the button they choose, they recieve a picture of the aforementioned animal. The two APIs used were TheCatAPI (accessed from: https://thecatapi.com) and a Dogs API (accessed from: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random).
